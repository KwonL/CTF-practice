# Flaskcards Skeleton Key

We got secret key, 06f4eefabf03b8f4e521fbdada13f65c. And we can know encrypted session value..

I found following useful tool :

https://github.com/noraj/flask-session-cookie-manager

By using this, we can freely manage session. Modify id as '1' and send it. We can access to admin page.
