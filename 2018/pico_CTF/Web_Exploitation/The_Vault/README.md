First, I recognized there are some hidden value named "debug", but can not much information about htmlspecialchars().

Later I was thinking about how to bypass filtering for sql injection. While searching for the `preg_match` function, I found that if the input string is an Array, it displays WARNING. 

The return value will be -1, so you can do an injection from the password!
