# Leak Me!

At first I thought of buffer overflow. However, this was not possible because the program had a size for each input. 

One interesting thing was that the password was immediately after the name on the stack. 

So can I overwrite my password with name? I thought. Do not set a null byte if there is no \n character in the user input, like this: 

```
fgets(name, sizeof(name), stdin);
char *end = strchr(name, '\n');
    if (end != NULL) {
    *end = '\x00';
}
```

Thus, if the size of the input is exactly the same as the buffer size of name, we will be able to append the password and string. Later puts function will leak passwords nicely.
