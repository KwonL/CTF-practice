            <p>As someone who is just getting started with Linux, I love Canonical. They build the easiest to use Linux distribution I can find, and they build so many useful tools. So far I've tried out</p>

            <h1>Learning PHP</h1>
            <p>I recently learned about PHP and I can't stop switching everything over to it. In fact, this blog is now powered by PHP, I think! I changed the file extension at least, and added a little PHP code below here. That should pretty much do it right? I have the PHP code commented out for now since I can't seem to get it to work right. I'll have to look into it later.</p>
